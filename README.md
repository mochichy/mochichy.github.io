# znfish.github.io

1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	This project is my personal portfolio. The purpose of this project is to gather and share the works I have done in Info343 class this quarter. The creativity part of this project is the rainbow! page. Users can make their own rainbow words by simpling type in the texts they like. I believe rainbow brings people happiness and I think it would be great to share this happiness with people who read my portfolio.
